*  This program tests your calc_widths function implementation. It does assume  
* that you've already properly implemented print_table, so make sure to fix     
* that first.

*  It runs calc_width on a couple of pre-defined tables and prints them out     
* with the caculated widths.                                                    
*                                                                               
*  The reference output was done by running this program without command line   
* arguments.

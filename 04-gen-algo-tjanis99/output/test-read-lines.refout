* if you don't give it any command line arguments, but it will print the        
* contents of any files you pass it.

In Congress, July 4, 177

The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the
Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the
political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the
powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature
and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

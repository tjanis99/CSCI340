## CSCI 470 - Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis - Northern Illinois University (NIU)

- This course covers the application of analysis and design techniques to nonnumeric algorithms acting on data structures, and the utilization of algorithmic analysis and design criteria in the selection of methods for data manipulation. This course will have computing projects and extensive laboratory work using C++.

  - Sequential and associative containers
  - Algorithms, including sorting and algorithm analysis
  - Binary trees, including tree balancing
  - Heaps, B-Trees, and hashes
  - Graphs, including representation, traversals, and algorithms
